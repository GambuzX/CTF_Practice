0 -> 1
Found the hidden .backup folder with a 'bookmarks.html' file inside.
Used grep to search for 'password' and found it.



1 -> 2
Using gdb understood that the password was 'sex'. Could also have just skipped the line in the debugger.

Running the executable and inserting the password we get a shell, in which our uid is leviathan2.

After that you can just use 'cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2' to get 'ougahZi8Ta'.



2 -> 3
Analysing the executable with ltrace, we understand that there are 2 important function calls: access and cat.

Access is being called with the full path name. However, cat is not. If the input file has spaces, it will be interpreted as 2 separate files.

We can exploit this by creating a symbolic link to /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3 called 'pass' (for example) and creating a file 'test pass'.

When we run the executable in the 'test pass' file, it will check access to 'test pass', which is granted, and then cat files 'test' and 'pass'.
