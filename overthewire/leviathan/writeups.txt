Found the hidden .bookmarks file.
Used grep to search for password and found it.

Using gdb understood that the password was 'sex'. Could also have just skipped the line in the debugger.

Running the executable and inserting the password we get a shell, in which our uid is leviathan2.

After that you can just use 'cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2' to get 'ougahZi8Ta'.
